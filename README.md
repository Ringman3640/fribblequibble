## Development Environment
- Vite + SWC
- React
- TypesScript
- styled-components

## Publishing
FribbleQuibble was previously hosted on Netlify as a static site. However, due to the recent [news about potential immense charges on the free tier](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39520776), I have removed the frontend site. 

I will likely rehost the site on Cloudflare Pages, but I am unsure when I will have time to do this.
